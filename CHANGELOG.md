# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-07
### Added
- Document Symbols / Outline support for `DEF`, `DEFFCT` and `DEFDAT` blocks. Functions and data modules now appear in the Outline view, in Breadcrumbs, and via the symbol picker (Ctrl+Shift+O).

### Fixed
- `Go to Definition` failed when the symbol was written with a different case than its declaration. KRL is case-insensitive, but variable, struct and function lookups compared names strictly. Now all lookups are case-insensitive, and the jump position is computed correctly even when the file uses a different casing than the call site.
